Hummingword - [HTML5 Word Clouds](http://www.hackyon.com/hummingword)
===============================

Create stunning word clouds right in your browser using nothing but HTML5. This is meant to be both a showcase and an experiment of HTML5. This experiment requires the canvas element. The computation runs on WebWorkers when supported. There is also a HTML5 fullscreen mode. The generated image can be downloaded with the help of data-URI (not really HTML5, but still cool).

Suggestions are welcomed. Let me know if you would like to see a version where clouds conform to certain shapes, as with [Tagxedo](http://www.tagxedo.com/).

The source should be pretty self-explanatory, but feel free to contact me if you have questions.
